# 🚀 Codelyzer

Codelyzer is a web-based coding platform designed to help developers practice, test, and improve their programming skills.
It provides an interactive UI where users can write code in multiple programming languages and run it against predefined test cases configured by administrators.

## ✨ Features

* 🧑‍💻 **Multi-language support** – Write and execute code in various programming languages
* 🧪 **Automated test case validation** – Submissions are compiled and evaluated against admin-defined test cases
* ⚡ **Real-time execution results** – Instantly view pass/fail status and output
* 🎯 **Practice-focused environment** – Similar experience to platforms like LeetCode/HackerRank
* 🔐 **Admin controls** – Admins can:

  * Create coding problems
  * Configure input/output test cases
  * Set execution constraints
  * Manage submissions

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Codelyzer consists of:

* **Frontend UI** – Code editor, problem viewer, and results display
* **Backend Service** – Handles submissions, compilation requests, and result processing
* **Execution Engine** – Securely compiles and runs code in isolated environments
* **Database** – Stores problems, test cases, and submission history

---

## 🧰 Supported Languages

The platform supports multiple languages such as:

* Java
* Python
* C++
* JavaScript
* (Extendable to more languages)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User selects a coding problem.
2. Writes code in the preferred language.
3. Submits solution.
4. Backend compiles and runs code against admin-defined test cases.
5. Results are returned and displayed in the UI.
